# Documentary FAHKUMRAM Changes

**All changes, cancels, new stuff listed and commented**

This Fahkumram moveset is leaning more towards his Tekken 7 iteration, while also having my own spin on it.
Overall leaning to the 'overbuffed' side, but not overpowered. He is still weak to sidesteps and unsafe on whiffs. In my opinion he feels more explosive and fun to play. 
He still feels most comfortable at long-mid range and his b3+4 is now amazing at bullying and creating the perfect distance.
Impatient opponents will be punished a bit more now since his counter-hit tools now give Garuda Force and overall there are now more ways to spend it and cash out.

### Design-philosophy / Introduction 

This Fahkumram moveset is leaning more towards his Tekken 7 iteration, while also having my own spin on it.
Overall leaning to the 'overbuffed' side, but not overpowered. He is yet weak to sidesteps and unsafe on whiffs and therefore quite commital. 
In my opinion he feels more explosive and fun to play, while still being methodical and risky. 
He kept being most comfortable at long-mid range and his b3+4 is now amazing at bullying and creating the perfect distance.
Impatient opponents will be punished a bit more now since his counter-hit tools now give Garuda Force and overall there are now more ways to spend it and cash out.

## d+4

	- 3,4,3,b
		Sped up the cancel, induces strong aerial tailspin on airborne opponents

	- Changed the reaction on hit on airborn opponents to a strong aerial tailspin

## RAM.2
	- Reduced recovery frames by 4F

# Tips & Tricks
	- utilize his b3+4 to create and maintain distance
 	- his b+1 now guarantees a f2,1 or f2,1,2 if you have Garuda! 
  	- all df+1 strings all beat different things. use df+1,2 for a safe followup that beats interrupting his other followups. df+1,4 to beat sidestepping his other options... feel free to experiment!
   	- the new move 'uf+1 HOLD' is a great way to cash out some damage at the end of a juggle, but also a very strong pressure tool. be careful, as it is quite linear! 
	- his fully charged moves now guardbreak without garuda, very good for pressuring at the wall
	- df3+4,3 serves as a 13f punish, but df3+4 alone leaves you at +9F on hit and is safe at -9 on block. Good to throw out now and then if you call out a duck. Careful tho, as his df3+4,3 is -12 and duckable!
	- after df3,3 (or df4,3,3) on hit grant you a mini combo (or fullcombo depending on size). Mini combo is: d+2 > ws.4 > b+1 > d4. On larger chars you can heat burst after the ws.4!  
 	- 3,1,d2 is great as a wallcombo for floorbreaks
	- RAM.2 recovers faster, which will now grant a full combo on a wallsplat!
	- with 3,1,4 being safe now, you can fish better for crouching opponents and with tight execution even hitconfirm it into 3,1,4,4!
	- RAM.1 is now guaranteed after guardbreaks with Garuda Install

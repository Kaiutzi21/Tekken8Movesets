### [Design-philosophy / Introduction]

King Design Philosophy – “DLC / Boss Mode”  
This version was deliberately designed to be exaggerated, as if he was an overpowered DLC Character or as a “boss character”. 
Moves received massive upgrades in damage, visuals, and presence – whether through new cancels, unbreakable grabs or other properties. 
The mechanics are not aimed at balance, but at fun, showmanship, and pure explosiveness. 
This moveset serves as a declaration of love for his identity.
